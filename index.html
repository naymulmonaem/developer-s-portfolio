        <h3>Squirrel</h3>
        <p>Tree squirrels have slender, lanky bodies, long, muscular limbs, and furred feet. 
            The forefeet have four long digits plus a short, stubby thumb, and the five-toed hind 
            feet are narrow or moderately wide. The bald soles of the feet take the form of prominent,
            fleshy pads.</p>

        <h2><span class="five">Ocean</span> & <span class="five">Sea</span></h2>
        <p>When viewed from space, the predominance of Earth’s oceans is readily apparent. 
            The oceans and their marginal seas cover nearly 71 percent of Earth’s surface, with 
            an average depth of 3,688 metres (12,100 feet). The exposed land occupies the remaining
             29 percent of the planetary surface and has a mean elevation of about 840 metres (approximately 2,755 feet). 
             Actually, all the elevated land could be hidden under the oceans and Earth reduced to a smooth sphere that 
             would be completely covered by a continuous layer of seawater more than 2,600 metres (8,530 feet) deep. 
             This is known as the sphere depth of the oceans and serves to underscore the abundance of water on Earth’s surface.</p>
