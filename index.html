        <h3>Squirrel</h3>
        <p>Tree squirrels have slender, lanky bodies, long, muscular limbs, and furred feet. 
            The forefeet have four long digits plus a short, stubby thumb, and the five-toed hind 
            feet are narrow or moderately wide. The bald soles of the feet take the form of prominent,
            fleshy pads.</p>

        <h3>Important Tool of our daily life</h3>
        <p>A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose microcomputer whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use.[1] Personal computers are intended to be operated directly by an end user, rather than by a computer expert or technician. Unlike large, costly minicomputers and mainframes, time-sharing by many people at the same time is not used with personal computers. Primarily in the late 1970s and 1980s, the term home computer was also used.</p>
